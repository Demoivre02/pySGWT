PySGWT
------

Python implementation of the Spectral Graph Wavelet Transform (SGWT) [1]. 

The code is a port of the MATLAB implementation provided by the authors
(available at http://wiki.epfl.ch/sgwt). The original code is released under
GPLv3, so I guess this code should have the same license (I am not sure about
this at the moment, the point seems to be moot. See [2] and [3] and for
instance.)
